# Conan-The-Caveman

This game was made by reading SDL Game Development Book and other people code. I added some code, headers, 
tiles and enlarged the map. Before i added new codes it was only scrolling horizontally. There was some bugs and i fixed them.
I hope this will help you people who read the book.
